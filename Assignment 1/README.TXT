You must first follow the instructions on aima-python github.

To run the code first you need to navigate to the vacuum_world.jpynb file. Then progress 
down the file and run each of the cells. The first three cells must be ran for every example
to be run but after they are ran once any of the examples can be tested. 

After running one example make sure to run a delete_thing() function 
call to delete the previous agent from causing
any confusion. If the cells are run in order then no issues should arise.
